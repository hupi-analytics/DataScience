Data qualification tools / Outils de qualification des donn√©es



Introduction :
In this folder, you will find some tools for outliers detection, discretisation, correlation analysis and text correction



Description :

This package has (for the moment) 4 tools :

- outliers detection : We use some statistical test and/or some hypothesis to determine if there is outliers in the RDD. Then there is a function to replace this points with some features like mean, mediane, nearest quantile, nearest "maximum", ... 

- discretisation : This function allows you to discretized a quantitative variable with many options.

- correlation : There is a lot of function on dataframe which compute some features about correlation. 

- text correction : With this function you can directly correct your text, it mostly removes typing mistakes.
